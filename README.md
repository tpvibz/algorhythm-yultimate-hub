🥏 Y-Ultimate Digital Platform
AI-Powered Tournament & Coaching Management for Ultimate Frisbee Communities

Y-Ultimate empowers children from under-resourced communities by teaching life skills like teamwork, fairness, and respect through Ultimate Frisbee.
This platform transforms how tournaments and coaching programs are managed — shifting from manual spreadsheets to a unified, intelligent, real-time digital ecosystem.

⚠️ Problem

Y-Ultimate currently uses Google Sheets & Forms, leading to operational challenges :

Fragmented player & tournament records
No central historical data
Manual tournament operations
No real-time match or coaching updates
Hard to track attendance, home visits & LSAS assessments
Delayed reporting & limited visibility
These issues slow operations, reduce transparency, and limit scalability.

✔️ Centralized coaching system (child profiles → attendance → LSAS → home visits)
✔️ Real-time dashboards & automated reporting
✔️ Voice input + multilingual UI for on-field usage

✔️ Blockchain-secured fair-play scoring ledger

Makes Y-Ultimate transparent, scalable, and data-driven.
